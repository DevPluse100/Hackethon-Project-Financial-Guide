# Hackethon Project

A full-stack application with a React frontend and an Express backend.

## Description

This project is a hackathon submission that involves a frontend built with React (Vite) and a backend API using Express and MongoDB. The application allows users to interact with [insert functionality, e.g., "manage user profiles"].

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (if running the backend locally)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hackethon.git
cd hackethon


.gitignore for hackethon Project
In your project, since you have a server and a client (frontend), you will need to maintain separate .gitignore files for both parts. The root .gitignore file will typically include certain files and folders common to both, while each subproject (server and client) will have its own .gitignore to exclude platform-specific or dependency-related files.

Here’s how to structure them:

1. Root .gitignore (for the entire project)
This .gitignore should include things common to both the server and client directories. For example:

plaintext
Copy code
# Node.js related files
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
yarn-error.log

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Build and temporary files
dist/
build/

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.vscode/

# IDE files (if applicable)
.idea/

# Logs
*.log
This .gitignore should be in the root directory of your hackethon project.

2. Server .gitignore
The server folder likely contains backend code (using Express, for example), so this .gitignore should focus on server-related dependencies and environment files:

plaintext
Copy code
# Node.js related files
node_modules/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Logs and temp files
npm-debug.log
yarn-error.log

# Build directories (if any)
build/
dist/

# IDE files
.idea/

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
This .gitignore should be placed inside the server/ directory.

3. Client .gitignore
The client folder contains frontend code, likely using React, Vite, or similar tools. Here’s a typical .gitignore for the frontend:

plaintext
Copy code
# Node.js related files
node_modules/

# Build files (Vite, React, etc.)
dist/
build/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# IDE files
.idea/

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Vite cache
.vite/

# npm logs
npm-debug.log
yarn-error.log
This .gitignore should go inside the client/ directory.

README.md for Your hackethon Project
The README.md is crucial for setting up and understanding your project. It should provide all the necessary instructions for how to get the project running, how to contribute, and other relevant details.

Here’s an example structure for the README.md:

1. Project Title
markdown
